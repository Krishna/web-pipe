INTRODUCTION

web-pipe is a simple, bare-bones web content generation tool. I just wanted something to help generate static web content in a really simple manner.

REQUIREMENTS

You will need:
	- Ruby
	- The rdiscount gem (http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/tree/master)


GETTING STARTED

1. Create your content as Markdown files. Save these files in the InTray directory with the file extension '.md.txt'
2. Run the gen.rb script. This will:
	- generate one HTML file in the OutTray directory, for each file in the InTray. 

TEMPLATES? STYLESHEETS?

At the moment the following document templates are supplied:

- main_page_template.erb.txt : the template used to generate the documents with.
- index_creation_time_page_template.erb.txt : an archives page template
- index_modified_time_page_template.erb.txt : the index page template

The templates makes use of a CSS stylesheet, found at: OutTray/styles/main.css

ENHANCEMENTS

- Need a script to generate an RSS or ATOM feed for the website
- Need a script that will upload the generated web content to a web host
