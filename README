INTRODUCTION

web-pipe is a simple, bare-bones web content generation tool. I just wanted something to help generate static web content in a really simple manner.

REQUIREMENTS

You will need:
	- Ruby
	- The rdiscount gem (http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/tree/master)


GETTING STARTED

1. Create your content as Markdown files. Save these files in the InTray directory with the file extension '.md.txt'
2. Run the gen.rb script. This will:
	- generate one HTML file for each file in the InTray. HTML files are placed in the OutTray directory
	- each file in the InTray is then moved to the Archives directory. The filename is changed so it has a date stamp prefix: YYYYMMDD_<original filename>

TEMPLATES? STYLESHEETS?

At the moment there is only one template supported and that is buried in the gen.rb script.

The template makes use of a CSS stylesheet, found at: OutTray/styles/main.css

ENHANCEMENTS

- Need a script to generate an index (front) page for a website
- Need a script to generate an RSS or ATOM feed for the website
- Need a script that will upload the generated web content to a web host
