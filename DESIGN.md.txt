This file serves as a log of the design decisions made on the project.

No longer am moving files from the InTray directory to an Archives directory.
The thinking here is that we should get the 'date created' and 'date updated' information directly from the filestamps in the filesystem. This makes it a lot easier to edit a specific file at a later date.

Drawback: everytime you generate the site, every file will need to be processed. This shouldn't be a problem for anything but MASSIVE sites.
