Now creating the datestamps for the output filename using the source file's creation time.

Modified the html output generation routine to take the source file's creation and last modified timestamps.

No longer am moving files from the InTray directory to an Archives directory.
The thinking here is that we should get the 'date created' and 'date updated' information directly from the filestamps in the filesystem. This makes it a lot easier to edit a specific file at a later date.

Drawback: everytime you generate the site, every file will need to be processed. This shouldn't be a problem for anything but MASSIVE sites.
